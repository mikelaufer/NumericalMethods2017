* LaTEX Practice
** Dependencies
1. linux package aspell-en
2. emacs packages: flyspell, cdlatex, auctex, texlive?
3. Make sure that preamble.tex is in the same folder as the org document

** Q1. Let's try some stuff out
  + To see latex snippets use ctrl-( c x l). cancel with ctrl-(c c)
  + How about some fractions? 
\[\frac{1}{2} + 7 = 7.5\]
  +  Let's try the continuity equation
\[\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\rho u\right)\]

Pure Latex seems to work as well:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} + 6x + x^{2}
\end{equation}

cdlatex mode allows for auto-completion:
1. using fr <tab> creates fraction template
2. using ^ raises to a power. $x^{2}$
3. equ <tab> creates numbered equation template
4. tilda key opens menu of shortcuts, so tilda d creates $\delta$. Tilda-tilda d creates $\partial$.

** Workflow
- words in org mode
- math in latex with cdlatex
- export as pdf with M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf RET
** ToDo list: [0/4]
- [ ] Learn how to insert figures with descriptions
- [ ] learn how to use bibliography
- [ ] learn how to insert code snippets
- [ ] Learn how to create figure list,
